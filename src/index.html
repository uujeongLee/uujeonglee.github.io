                    Do you remember the day we first met? I remember how you looked, what you were wearing, and the feeling you gave me. My heart fluttered when you smiled at me. I could sense your pure heart, and it felt wonderful. I remember how nervous I was talking to you and how you made me feel at ease. I remember everything about that day, and I'm so grateful it happened.
                    Looking back now, I wanted to tell you that I really wanted to take a photo together with you, but I was nervous to say it. I'm glad I found the courage to talk about it! I can cherish these photos now. Your smile, then and now, is so beautiful.

                    The day we watched the Purdue basketball game together was so much fun, wasn't it? I really wanted to see a game with you, and I'm thankful you asked around for tickets. When you got us matching basketball shirts for the game, I was even more excited from the start. 'You got this for me, thinking of me...?' I was touched that you thought of me like that. Purdue played so well too! It was really enjoyable. Cheering together and holding hands for the first time made it even more exciting~!

Spending so much time together allowed us to share many stories and I felt like I got to know you better. Thank you for picking me up every morning, even though you might be sleepy. Also I appreciate the delicious coffee you made. I still remember how good it tasted. It's my favorite coffee in the world! I miss hanging out at your place and I'd love to visit again soon. I miss you! </p>

                    Indianapolis was so beautiful! White River State Park was especially my favorite. After going there with you, I wanted to visit again before coming to Korea. The day we went together was the best day. Thank you for taking me there! It was nice exploring Indianapolis, seeing the neighborhood where you interned, having delicious brunch, trying purple coffee for the first time, and exploring downtown. Will you take me there next time too?? Promise me! I'll always be by your side.

The hot dogs were delicious, Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago were amazing, and the skyline at night was unforgettable. Remember how we even wore matching white shirts that day? I was so happy and had such a good time with you. Thank you for making wonderful memories together. I've always felt this way, but you were so sweet and affectionate when we went to Chicago together. I want to emulate your personality. You're fun, smart, and affectionate, and I love those aspects of you.</p>

I loved being able to stay there with you and your family(include Devo). I appreciate you showing us around Seattle and making plans for us, especially since it was right after your exams and must have been hard to prepare for. It was such a perfect trip. I have such great memories of Seattle, it feels like a second home now whenever I hear the name. I'm so grateful we got to spend every hour together for a whole week. If you ever visit Korea, I hope I can give you the same wonderful memories you gave me in Seattle! Just the thought of you possibly visiting Korea makes me excited and thrilled!
